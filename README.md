# Hybrid-Ensemble-Based-Malicious-Software-Predictor-Using-Stacking-and-Real-Time-API
Project uses Random Forest, MLP, and Gradient Boost in a stacking classifier for malware prediction. Features are encoded and scaled; training uses UNSW dataset. Implements data preprocessing, ensemble learning, and real-time API with Flask for detection interface.
